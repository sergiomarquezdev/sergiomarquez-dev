    "summary": "Backend Developer transitioned into AI/ML. After several years developing with Java and Spring, I've moved towards applying an engineering-first approach (APIs, data, architecture, and production) to AI solutions using Python and FastAPI. I specialize in building services that transform business needs into maintainable features, incorporating RAG pipelines, semantic search, and agentic architectures. I focus on making the 'how it works' as solid as the 'what it does' through automation and robust engineering practices."
